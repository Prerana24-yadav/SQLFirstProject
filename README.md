# SQLFirstProject
I completed an advanced SQL data analysis project using Pizza Orders, Order Details, Pizzas, and Pizza Types datasets in MySQL Workbench. I performed complex joins, aggregations, subqueries, and group by analysis to identify sales trends, most ordered pizza sizes, revenue contribution, and customer ordering patterns for business insights.
